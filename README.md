# Spryker Feature: Approval process

The Approval Process feature enables managers to control purchases requested by their employees. A customer can choose to have an order approved by a responsible person before allowing the checkout. The company administrator can limit some roles with flexible permissions and define a threshold on the Cart Total value so a buyer would need to ask for approval when the Cat Total limit is exceeded.
